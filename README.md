# Fractal_World_Playground

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is my playground to test out some
world generation stuff.

Since I found out my code does not work in Minecraft
I made the source code public so that anyone can help
me to find out how to get this stuff working in Minecraft.

I'm also very new to the complete world generation part, so
any explanation of what the code does is helpfull. ;)


### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Document the code with JavaDoc and normal comments!
* All pull-requests have to be based on the 'Development'-Branch. 

**This project is also for learning purpose! Any code which is not documented will get removed!**
